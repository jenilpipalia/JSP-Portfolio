# JSP-Portfolio
Hello, fellow coders! I'm Jenil Pipaliya. I created this portfolio to enhance my design and responsiveness skills. The standout feature of this portfolio is its use of scroll-triggered animations, achieved with the assistance of the JavaScript plugin AOS - Animate On Scroll.

This entire website draws inspiration from a Bootstrap theme and was developed as a practice project. I'm sharing the link to the theme website, which is absolutely free. You can find it here: https://startbootstrap.com/theme/personal.
